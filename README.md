# BrewIT

## Project Goal

To develop an application that simplifies collaboration between contract and commercial breweries. The platform will facilitate equipment rentals, resource management and tracking production processes. It offers tailored features for each user type: administrators get operational insights, commercial breweries manage resources, and contract breweries reserve equipment and document production steps in real time.
